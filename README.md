# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This is a solution to the [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). The Project required me to fetch random pieces of advice from an API, and display it on the front end.

## My process
I used async and await to grab data from the API. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I managed to gain more knowledge on how to use Async and Await to fetch data from remote sources. I time boxed this entire process, and it took me 3 pomodoros of thirty minutes each to completely install packages needed for this project and build this project.

### Useful resources

- [The tailwind docs](www.tailwindcss.com) - The docs are a pretty good place to start when learning, and the Tailwind docs do a great job of showing guides and references.
